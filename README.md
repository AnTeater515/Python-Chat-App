# Chat Aplication using Python QtNetwork
#Developed By : AnTeater515

Basic chat application based on TCP Sockets. I have implementated this using QtNetwork module.

####Componets:
1. chat-server.py - needed to execute on the terminal
2. chat.py - needed to exetute on client PC.

### How to run this application
1. execute both 'chat-server.py and chat.py'
2. enter the hostname/ IP address on client PC. Server will establish a connection between sever and client through a socket.
3. now send text from client to server and vise versa. 
#### Dependancies:
1. Python
2. PyQt4(for GUI)

####  Procedure:
1. Run "chat.py" using this command "python chat.py"
2. Create Server using this command "python chat-server.py"
3. Invite other user :)
